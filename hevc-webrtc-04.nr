H.265 Profile for WebRTC

draft-ietf-avtcore-hevc-webrtc-00.txt

Abstract

.in +0.3i
RFC 7742 defines WebRTC video processing and codec requirements, including 
guidance for endpoints supporting the VP8 and H.264 codecs, which are mandatory
to implement.
With support for H.265 under development in WebRTC browsers,
similar guidance is needed for browsers considering support for the
H.265 codec, whose RTP payload format is defined in RFC 7798.

Introduction

.in +0.3i
"RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)" [RFC7798] defines 
the encapsulation of H.265 [H.265] within the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550]. 
While "WebRTC Video Processing and Codec Requirements" [RFC7742] provides
guidance for endpoints supporting the mandatory to implement VP8 and H.264 codecs,
it does not cover H.265. With H.265 support under development within browsers [HEVC-WebKit][HEVC-Chrome]
there is a need to for an interoperability profile of [RFC7798] for WebRTC implementations choosing to support
H.265.

Terminology

.in +0.3i
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

H.265 Support

.in +0.3i
Support for the H.265 video codec is OPTIONAL for WebRTC browsers and non-browsers.
Implementations supporting H.265 that conform to this specification MUST support
receiving H.265 and MAY support sending H.265. 

For the H.265 [H.265] codec, endpoints MUST support the payload formats
defined in [RFC7798]. In addition, they MUST support Main Profile
Level 3.1 (level-id=93) and SHOULD support Main Profile Level 4 (level-id=120).

[RFC7798] Section 4.5 defines how Temporal Scalability Control Information (TSCI)
is communicated using PACI Extensions defined in [RFC7798] Section 4.4.4.2.
A WebRTC implementation that has negotiated use of RTP header extensions
containing TSCI information (such as the Dependency Descriptor [DD]) SHOULD 
NOT send TSCI information within the PACI.  If TSCI information is
being received in an RTP header extension, implementations MUST
ignore TSCI information contained in the PACI.

Implementations of the H.265 codec have utilized a wide variety of
optional parameters.  To improve interoperability, the following
parameter settings are specified:

level-id: Implementations SHOULD include this parameter within SDP and
MUST interpret it when receiving it. If no level-id is present, a
value of 93 (i.e., level 3.1) MUST be inferred.

tx-mode: Implementations SHOULD NOT include this parameter within SDP.
If no tx-mode parameter is present, a value of "SRST" MUST be inferred.
Implementations MUST support "SRST"; support for "MRST" and "MRMT"
is OPTIONAL. Implementations that do not support "MRST" or
"MRMT" MUST NOT include these tx-mode values in SDP.

sprop-sps, sprop-pps, sprop-vps, sprop-sei: H.265 allows sequence and picture information
to be sent both in-band and out-of-band.  WebRTC implementations
MUST signal this information in-band.  This means that WebRTC
implementations MUST NOT include these parameters in the SDP they
generate, and SHOULD silently ignore these parameters if they
are received. An IDR sent MUST always be preceded by the relevant
parameter sets sent in a packet (not necessarily a separate packet)
with the same RTP timestamp as the IDR.

When the use of the video orientation (CVO) RTP header extension is
not signaled as part of the SDP, H.265 implementations MAY send and
SHOULD support proper interpretation of Display Orientation SEI
messages.

[RFC7798] Section 8.3 specifies the use of the Reference Picture Selection
Indication (RPSI) in H.265. Implementations MUST use the RPSI feedback 
message only as a reference picture selection request, and MUST NOT use it
as positive acknowledgement. Receivers that detect that H.265 encoder-decoder
synchronization has been lost SHOULD generate an RPSI feedback message if
support for RPSI has been negotiated, unless the receiver has knowledge that
the sender does not support RPSI. Such knowledge can be established during
capability exchange or through previously sent RPSI requests that were
not replied to by the sender through the use of a non-IRAP picture.
An RTP packet-stream sender that receives an RPSI message MUST act
on that message, and SHOULD change the reference picture.

Unless otherwise signaled, WebRTC implementations that support H.265 MUST encode
and decode pixels with an implied 1:1 (square) aspect ratio.

Security Considerations

.in +0.3i
This document is subject to the security considerations described in
Section 7 of [RFC7742].

In addition to those security considerations, H.265 implementers
are advised to take note of the "Security Considerations" Section 9
of [RFC7798], including requirements pertaining to SEI messages.
