                 draft-ietf-avtcore-hevc-webrtc-05.txt

Abstract

   RFC 7742 defines WebRTC video processing and codec requirements,
   including guidance for endpoints supporting the VP8 and H.264 codecs,
   which are mandatory to implement.  With support for H.265 under
   development in WebRTC browsers, similar guidance is needed for
   browsers considering support for the H.265 codec, whose RTP payload
   format is defined in RFC 7798.

INTERNET-DRAFT          H.265 Profile for WebRTC         9 November 2024


1.  Introduction

   "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)"
   [RFC7798] defines the encapsulation of H.265 [H.265] within the Real-
   time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  While "WebRTC Video
   Processing and Codec Requirements" [RFC7742] provides guidance for
   endpoints supporting the mandatory to implement VP8 and H.264 codecs,
   it does not cover H.265. With H.265 support under development within
   browsers [HEVC-WebKit][HEVC-Chrome] there is a need to for an
   interoperability profile of [RFC7798] for WebRTC implementations
   choosing to support H.265.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  H.265 Support

   Support for the H.265 video codec is OPTIONAL for WebRTC browsers and
   non-browsers.  Implementations supporting H.265 that conform to this
   specification MUST support receiving H.265 and MAY support sending
   H.265.

   For the H.265 [H.265] codec, endpoints MUST support the payload
   formats defined in [RFC7798]. In addition, they MUST support Main
   Profile Level 3.1 (level-id=93) and SHOULD support Main Profile Level
   4 (level-id=120).

   [RFC7798] Section 4.5 defines how TSCI is communicated using PACI
   Extensions defined in [RFC7798] Section 4.4.4.2.  A WebRTC
   implementation that has negotiated use of RTP header extensions
   containing TSCI information (such as the Dependency Descriptor [DD])
   SHOULD NOT send TSCI information within the PACI.  If TSCI
   information is being received in an RTP header extension,
   implementations MUST ignore TSCI information contained in the PACI.

   [RFC7798] Section 4.4.2 describes how APs are carried within RTP
   payloads:

      "An AP consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr)
      followed by two or more aggregation units... The value of TID MUST
      be the lowest value of TID of all the aggregated NAL units.

         Informative note: All VCL NAL units in an AP have the same TID
         value since they belong to the same access unit.  However, an
         AP may contain non-VCL NAL units for which the TID value in the
         NAL unit header may be different than the TID value of the VCL
         NAL units in the same AP."

   Within an RTP payload, VCL NAL units MUST NOT be aggregated with non-
   VCL NAL units with a lower TID value.  Instead the non-VCL NAL units
   with a lower TID value MUST be packetized within a distinct RTP
   packet.  This ensures that a MANE or SFM can forward VCL and non-VCL
   NAL units to the correct set of participants.

2.1.  Parameters

   Implementations of the H.265 codec have utilized a wide variety of
   optional parameters.  To improve interoperability, the following
   parameter settings are specified:

   level-id: Implementations SHOULD include this parameter within SDP
   and MUST interpret it when receiving it. If no level-id is present, a
   value of 93 (i.e., Level 3.1) MUST be inferred. As noted in [RFC7798]



Aboba & Hancke               Standards Track                    [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT          H.265 Profile for WebRTC         9 November 2024


   Section 5, the "highest level indicated by the answer is either equal
   to or lower than that in the offer."

   tx-mode: Implementations SHOULD include this parameter within SDP.
   If no tx-mode parameter is present, a value of "SRST" MUST be
   inferred.  Implementations MUST support "SRST"; support for "MRST"
   and "MRMT" are OPTIONAL. Implementations that do not support "MRST"
   or "MRMT" MUST NOT include these tx-mode values in SDP.

   sprop-sps, sprop-pps, sprop-vps, sprop-sei: H.265 allows sequence and
   picture information to be sent both in-band and out-of-band.  WebRTC
   implementations MUST signal this information in-band.  This means
   that WebRTC implementations MUST NOT include these parameters in the
   SDP they generate, and SHOULD silently ignore these parameters if
   they are received. An IDR/CRA/BLA sent MUST always be preceded by the
   relevant parameter sets sent in a packet (not necessarily a separate
   packet) with the same RTP timestamp as the IDR/CRA/BLA.

   When the use of the video orientation (CVO) RTP header extension is
   not signaled as part of the SDP, H.265 implementations MAY send and
   SHOULD support proper interpretation of Display Orientation SEI
   messages.

   Unless otherwise signaled, WebRTC implementations that support H.265
   MUST encode and decode pixels with an implied 1:1 (square) aspect
   ratio.

2.2.  Feedback

   [RFC7798] Section 8.3 specifies the use of the Reference Picture
   Selection Indication (RPSI) in H.265. Implementations MUST use the
   RPSI feedback message only as a reference picture selection request,
   and MUST NOT use it as positive acknowledgement. Receivers that
   detect that H.265 encoder-decoder synchronization has been lost
   SHOULD generate an RPSI feedback message if support for RPSI has been
   negotiated, unless the receiver has knowledge that the sender does
   not support RPSI. Such knowledge can be established during capability
   exchange or through previously sent RPSI requests that were not
   replied to by the sender through the use of a non-IRAP picture.  An
   RTP packet-stream sender that receives an RPSI message MUST act on
   that message, and SHOULD change the reference picture.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document is subject to the security considerations described in
   Section 7 of [RFC7742].

   In addition to those security considerations, H.265 implementers are
   advised to take note of the "Security Considerations" Section 9 of
   [RFC7798], including requirements pertaining to SEI messages.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
